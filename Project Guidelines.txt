Kevin - Bitcoin
James - Ethereum
Kai - Polkadot
Briar - Cardano

First stage we each:

#Create an .ENV with a API_KEY

#Create a file that uses an API to gather crypto data from a website
#Suggest 3 years of week end data and weekly market capatilisation

Load the CSV file into the function
Clean data and create a table with 2 columns ['Date', 'Price(USD)']
Return data


Second stage:

Create a .ENV with all the API_KEYS in one spot

1.Sharpe ratio function

2.Long term investment function - cumulative returns

Best case function:
Calculate covariance using rolling analysis lagging 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 days behind comaprative coin
Attempting to prove that a coins price 'lags' another eg if Ethereum lags BTC by 3 days, we can create an Ethereum trading strategy based on this.

3.Plotting results

4.Final Conclusion of results - following theories are to be tested:
Volatility of coin
Long term returns
Does any coin follow the others?
